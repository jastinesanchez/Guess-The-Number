        "\n",
        "1. What is a variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. an example of a variable is String message;\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an operator?  List four examples (we covered this in class, but if the answer isn't coming to you, you can find examples later in the chapter).\n",
        "\n",
        "A: An operator is a special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of operators:\n",
        "\n",
        "* \"+\" (the addition operator)\n",
        "* \"-\" (the subtraction operator)\n",
        "* \"*\" (the multiplication operator)\n",
        "* \"/\" (the division operator)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How do you declare multiple variables at once?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: To declare multiple variables you would need to use a comma (,). There is an example below. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "// Put your answer to question 3 on the blank line below so that it is formatted correctly:\n",
        "int hour, minute;\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are the 'case' (upper and lower case) conventions for variable names?  How do they differ from Class names?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: the case convention for variable names are that variable names start with a lowercasee while class names start with an uppercase. The reason why variables are lowercase is because variables are case-sensitive, so firstName is not the same as either firstname or FirstName.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When you declare a variable, what are you doing in memory (storage)?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: When decalring a variable what you are doing in the memory is you are creating a storage location. \n",
        "\n",
        "6. When you assign a variable, what are you putting in that storage (memory) space?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: When assigning a variable what you are putting in the storage space is you are updating the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is a program's 'state'?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: The program's state are the make up of the variables in a program and their current values.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How do you display the name of a variable instead of its value?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: To display the name of the variable and not is value you would put it in quotes. For example instead of \n",
        "\n",
        "System.out.println(firstLine);\n",
        "\n",
        "you would put it like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "9. What is an expression?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: An expressions are generally a combination of numbers, variables and operators. \n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is an operand?  \n",
        "\n",
        "A: Operands are the values that operators work with. \n",
        "\n",
        "11.  If you want to perform division that will result in decimals, what datatype should you use?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: You would use the double variables if you want the result to have decimals. \n",
        "\n",
        "12. Assigning a value to a double this way `double y = 1 / 16;` is incorrect, what is the correct way to assign it?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: double y = 1.0 / 16.0;\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Float-point numbers round, which is fine for most things, but if you need absolute precision in your numbers, with no rounding, what does the book recommend doing?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: the book reccomens putting the decimal number as a whole integer, For example instead of doing:\n",
        "\n",
        "double balance = 123.45;\n",
        "\n",
        "do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "int balance = 12345;\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What will the + operator do when put between two Strings (not ints)?\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Example: \n",
        "String hi = \"Hi there\"; \n",

        "String hello = hi + bang;\n",

        "\n",
        "A: To overide the order of operations use parentheses\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the three kinds of errors?\n",
        "\n",
        "A: Three kind of errors are:\n",

        "\n",
        "A: \n",
        "\n",
        "* Compile-time errors: occur when you violate the rules of the Java language. An example are parentheses and braces have to come in matching pairs, so if you a parentheses or brace with only one, that is a complie-time error\n",
        "* Run-time errors: They don't appear until after the program has started running. These errors occur while the interpreter is executing byte code and something oes wrong. These errors are also called expection, and they are indicate that something unexpected has happen.\n",
        "* Logic Error: An error that will comple and run without generating errors, but it will still not do the right thing. It will do exactly it was told, even if you did not inteaded it, like putting the a message in two seperate lines. You would think it would combine but reality it would have them in two lines. \n",
